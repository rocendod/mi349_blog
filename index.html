        <p>I was born in Florida to migrant parents. I was their first child, they were exicited but also knew how diffulct it would be to raise a child because of thier work. Throughout my life and till this day they are Migrant Farm Worker. Living in different states was furstrating for me, as there was no place I could home. I hated the nosie of highway as it reapeated in my ear every time we moved. In my senior year of high school I had been to five different states and 15 different schools. My early life was tiring but I learn to enjoy the time I was with my family, they are my home as long as they are still around I will always have a place to come to. Of course there will be a time where I have to make my own and I hope to make it a place where my friends and family can come and feel comfortable and I place where my can have fun. </p>

        <p>Video games have always been fun to play and watch, just the time that you play with friend and family is so satisifiying and competative. Mario kart 64 is one the best games that I used to play with family, just the iconic rainbow road was amazing but frustarting because there was a high chance you fell off the track every turn. I like to watch people play games in my free time for example CarToonZ, it is also entertaing when gamers play with there friends as they also have fun and raging moments. </p>

        <p>I remember the time when I used to watch from the sidelines, where dads after work would father and play as thier heart content until the sun goes down. You could here the every other kid cheering for there father as I was in my heart. I have alway like futbol even though I was not good at it just the enjoyment of playing with my family was all I needed. As the years went by I got a bit better at it that I joined the soccer team in our high school, I met good friends those two years and learned that teamwork makes the dream work. When in family gathering my cousins were very competative when playing soccer but I was there to have fun. Scoring goals with the team I picked creating the best outcome it excited my how my cousin would gather up and try thier hardest to score on us. I was also suprised by the fact that my little brothers are able to keep up with other three times there age. During my time in MSU I found out how fun it was watching futbol with my friends and the passion that they fun for it always amazemes me. I will defitly be planning to watch some game with them in the future. Also if you are wondering I really don't have a favorie futbol team, but Barca teamwork in the past was crazy.</p>

        <p>I was born in Florida to migrant parents. I was their first child, they were exicited but also knew how diffulct it would be to raise a child because of thier work. Throughout my life and till this day they are Migrant Farm Worker. Living in different states was furstrating for me, as there was no place I could home. I hated the nosie of highway as it reapeated in my ear every time we moved. In my senior year of high school I had been to five different states and 15 different schools. My early life was tiring but I learn to enjoy the time I was with my family, they are my home as long as they are still around I will always have a place to come to. Of course there will be a time where I have to make my own and I hope to make it a place where my friends and family can come and feel comfortable and I place where my can have fun. </p>
